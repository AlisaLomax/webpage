		<h2>Alisa Lomax</h2>
		<div id="About">
			<p>I am a design engineer. I am based in London, where I am currently engaged on a renewable energy project, which aims to decarbonise a local site through the introduction of heat pumps. For this project I use excel for conducting 'back of the envelope' calculations.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I was most recently taking classes in portraiture, life drawing and sewing. These classes enabled me to maintain and improve on existing skills. (04/2025)</li>
